# Fraud Analytics Lakehouse

An end-to-end fraud analytics and risk decision platform built on a lakehouse-style architecture.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how fraud-related data can be transformed into
actionable risk insights using SQL-first analytics, machine learning risk scoring,
and decision-support dashboards.

## Key Components
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Analytics modeling (fact / dimension tables)
- SQL-based KPI computation
- ML-based fraud risk scoring
- Risk bucket analysis and dashboards

## Business Questions
1. Which transaction types contribute most to fraud risk?
2. How does fraud risk vary across different transaction amount ranges?
3. Are fraudulent transactions temporally clustered over time?
4. How effective is the existing rule-based fraud flagging compared to actual fraud labels?
5. Can transactions be segmented into risk buckets to support operational decision-making?
